<h2>About</h2>
"Tic Tac Toe" is based on the classic classroom pen-and-paper game for 2 players. 
This is my spin on the game, I wanted to keep the general theme of classroom and school; it brings me complete nostalgia and I hope it does to you too. :) 

This web application is built by using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. 

<h3> Technical Requirements </h3>
Your app must:
<ul>
    <li> Render a game in the browser </li> 
    <li> Switch turns between more than one player (2 player playing on a single computer)</li>
    <li> Design logic for winning & visually display which player won</li>
    <li> Design logic for a draw game & visually display when there is a draw</li>
    <li> Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files</li>
    <li> Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles</li>
    <li> Use Javascript for DOM manipulation</li>
    <li> Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it</li>
    <li> Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)</li>
</ul>

<h3> Approach Taken: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Planned my project by first doing the HTML (forming the skeleton)</li>
    <ul>
        <li> the grid of the whole game</li>
        <li> div with the rules</li>
        <li> the reset button</li>
    </ul>
<li>  Next I did some of the javascript </li>
    <ul>
        <li> I set up the variables by selecting all the neccessary elements on the page</li>
        <li> I made sure that I can place my mark onto the grid</li>
        <li>  Making sure my javascript file works as intended; mark placed once, all logic is correct</li>
    </ul>
<li>  Finally worked on the styling/css</li>
    <ul>
        <li> A very rough wireframe was sketched out </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
    
<h3> Unsolved Problems: </h3> 
<ul> 
    <li> This web application is not fully responsive. Sorry <3 </li>
</ul>

<h3> Future Development: </h3>
<!-- Extra ideas -->
    <!-- Prompt usernames -->
    <!-- Allow users pick X, O or other "characters"-->
    <!-- Add a toggle rules section -->
    <!-- Animation to "draw" the marks-->
    <!-- When there's a tie, the "school-bell" rings-->
