Approach Taken:
- Planned my project by first doing the HTML forming the skeleton
    - the grid of the whole game
    - div with the rules
    - the reset button
- Next I did some of the javascript
    - I set up the variables by selecting all the neccessary elements on the page
    - first I made sure that I can place my mark onto the grid



<!--Tic Tac Toe-->
    <!-- 9 squares have it as a classic tic-tac-toe grid like how did in school-->
    <!-- have background as notebook paper?-->
    <!-- Use images to place on top in textContent?-->
    <!-- blue and black as colors like pen?-->

    <!--Planning-->
    <!--1. Work on the skeleton of HTML-->
    <!--2. Simple basic CSS-->
    <!--3. Make the JS file work-->
        <!--a. BASICS FIRST NAOMI then go ham-->



<!-- Extra ideas -->
    <!-- prompt usernames? -->
    <!-- let users pick if they want X or O?-->
    <!-- have hightlight who's turn it is?  -->
    <!-- Curved board? curved wooden board -->
    <!-- hearts and crosses? -->
    <!-- Reset match YES/NO-->
    <!-- Add rules section - maybe toggle too? animation slide https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp-->
    <!-- animation to "draw" the marks-->
    <!-- When there's a tie, the "school-bell" rings-->

    <!-- Naomi's Notes:
        I want to remove the lines on the outside of the grid
    /* .oneSquare:first-child{
        border-left: none;
        border-top: none;
    } */ -->
        <!-- I want to make the cursor not avaliable after click;
        cursor: not-allowed; --></body></html>
