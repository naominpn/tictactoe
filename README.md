<h2>About</h2>
"Tic Tac Toe" is based on the classic classroom pen-and-paper game for 2 players. 
This is my spin on the game, I wanted to keep the general theme of classroom and school; it brings me complete nostalgia and I hope it does to you too. :) 

This web application is built by using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. 

<h3> Technical Requirements </h3>
Your app must:
    - Render a game in the browser
    - Switch turns between more than one player (2 player playing on a single computer)
    - Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
    - Design logic for a draw game & visually display when there is a draw
    - Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
    - Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles
    - Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
    - Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
    - Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

<h3> Approach Taken: </h3>
- Planned my project by first doing the HTML (forming the skeleton)
    - the grid of the whole game
    - div with the rules
    - the reset button
- Next I did some of the javascript
    - I set up the variables by selecting all the neccessary elements on the page
    - I made sure that I can place my mark onto the grid
    - Making sure my javascript file works as intended; mark placed once, all logic is correct
- Finally worked on the styling/css
    - A very rough wireframe was stretched out

A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Unsolved Problems: 
- This web application is not fully responsive. Sorry <3 

Future Development: 
<!-- Extra ideas -->
    <!-- Prompt usernames -->
    <!-- Allow users pick X, O or other "characters"-->
    <!-- Add a toggle rules section -->
    <!-- Animation to "draw" the marks-->
    <!-- When there's a tie, the "school-bell" rings-->
